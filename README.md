# DDos-Attack-Implementation
This DDos attack is done for educational purpose only and would be carried out on a dummy website

## System Requirements
1. Linux Operating System any distribution
2. Python

## Possible methods of implementing the attack
1. Ping Flood
2. SYN Flood
3. HTTP Flood
4. Using Botnets

### Ping Flood
To do this attack make sure you have hping3 installed if not, write apt install hping3 in the terminal. In this attack, we send multiple ping requests to a particular IP address, basically flood the server with these requests.

Ping Of Death: creating a buffer overflow sort of thing, now doesn't work

Catch: Can be easily stopped by closing ICMP port
